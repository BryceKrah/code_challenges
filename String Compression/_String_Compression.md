# String Compression
<p>Convert strings with repeating letters to number representation. Take case
sensitivity into consideration. e.g. "A" != "a". If the strings length is the
same in both scenarios. Return the original string instead.</p>


### Example
* "aaabbbbccccC" -> "a3b4c4C"
* "aabbcc" -> "aabbcc"

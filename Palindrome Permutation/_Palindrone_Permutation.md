# Palindrome Permutation
<p>Given a string determine if a permutation of the string is a palindrome (a word that is spelt the same forward as it is backwards). If yes, find all palindrome combinations with the letters in the string.

### Example
<p>The word "teammate" can be arranged in a variety of palindromes.
[teammaet, taemmeat, tmeaaemt, etc].</p>

# Palindrome Permutation
<p>Given a string determine if a permutation of the string is a palindrome (a word that is spelt the same forward as it is backwards). If yes, return true.

### Example
<p>The word "teammate" can be arranged in a variety of palindromes.
[teammaet, taemmeat, tmeaaemt, etc].<br/>
In the case of two or more strings, keep the letters within their word.<br/>
The string "mat mate" can be arranged into ["mat etam", "tam emat", "atm emta", etc]</p>
